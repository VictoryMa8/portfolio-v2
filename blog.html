                </h2>
                <p class="max-w-100 md:max-w-150 text-lg">Over the long weekend, my girlfriend and I decided to watch a
                    film
                    we both haven't seen before: The Grand Budapest Hotel by Wes Anderson. A film that, after watching
                    it for the first time, might be one of my favorite movies to date. This review intends to be as
                    spolier-free as possible.
                </p>
                <p class="max-w-100 md:max-w-150 text-lg">
                    This is the first Wes Anderson film I've ever watched, and I'm glad it was. It's incredibly
                    accessible, hilarious, and touching at times. Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori are exceptional actors
                    and they have great chemistry on-screen. Last year I watched <i>The Menu</i> with Fiennes, and that
                    was also an incredible watch, in large part due to his performance. He has this sort of gravity to
                    him that keeps you glued to the screen. His charisma is pretty amazing as M. Gustave; I think Wes
                    Anderson did a great job at making him a relatable yet enigmatic character. Many of the other
                    characters were also superb additions to the story. Dimitri, Joplin, and Henckels added a pefect
                    amount of intensity for this kind of murder mystery adventure film.
                </p>
                <p class="max-w-100 md:max-w-150 text-lg">
                    I thought the plot, overall theme, and message of the film were very well executed. Despite being
                    quite lighthearted at times, the message of keeping one's humanity in the face of facist (or simply
                    violent) barbarism is able to reach the viewer quite easily. I thought the dynamic between the older
                    Gustave and the younger Zero, being from two different worlds yet experiencing the same violence,
                    but at two different points of their life... absolute cinema. The fact that the settings were mostly
                    in fictional places was a great choice, I believe. It allows the viewer to place themselves in these
                    positions and allows them to fill in the gaps with their own experiences or ideas. At the same time,
                    I thought that making the facist army resemble real-life events was a great choice as well. There is
                    this certain emotional atmosphere that enters into films with this particular regime. Wes Anderson
                    allows that emotional gravity to enter without completely making the film about real history; his
                    choice to do
                    that was excellent in my opinion. He is able to capture the viewer and bring them into this
                    whimsical yet violent world that is very much adjacent to ours, and he makes us reflect on how we
                    got here. He makes us reflect on what's going on in our world, a world that never ceases with its
                    violence and barbarism. These characters, these untimely and gruesome deaths, these events, they are
                    all slightly unrealistic at times. And yet, they provokes us to
                    think
                    about how we cope with loss, fear, or troubling environments. Whether it's reaching for our cologne
                    that reminds of better times, or continuing habits that allow us to grasp at a time when the
                    violence
                    didn't engulf us completely, I think Wes Anderson understands how a large majority of people feel
                    when it comes to facing world events and injustice happening across the globe.
                </p>
                <p class="max-w-100 md:max-w-150 text-lg">
                    To pivot, I
                    thought
                    that the
                    cinematography was truly stunning. The wide shots and incredible splashes of color were beautiful.
                    This definitely makes me want to see more films by Wes Anderson. I really enjoy how unorthodox the
                    scenes looked; there is a unique tinge of character to every part of the film. Perhaps my only gripe
                    would be
                    the
                    visual effects
                    during the sledding or
                    snow scenes. They took me out of the movie just a little bit, as it wasn't particularly realistic.
                    In terms of the overall story-within-a-story narrative, I thought it was executed quite
                    thoughtfully. The older Zero speaking to the young writer was a well-crafted and charming
                    interaction. I thought it was the perfect touch to the main story, and sort of wraps it into this
                    nice bow at the end. I
                    recommend this film very much so, I
                    would rate it a
                    <b>6.75 out of 7!</b>

                <p class="max-w-100 md:max-w-150 text-lg">My friends and I decided to go out and try out some west asian
                    food
                    while
                    I was in
                    town for winter
                    break. I always drive by this spot on North Broadway, downtown Rochester. Parking is pretty simple,
                    there is street parking and even a parking ramp nearby (which is free in the evening). We got some
                    menus from the counter, sat down, and looked at our options.
                </p>
                <p class="max-w-100 md:max-w-150 text-lg">
                    There were few options, which is a good sign. Whatever they do, they must do very well. I decided to
                    try their falafel sandwich combo, which was about ten dollars. It included a falafel wrap, french
                    fries, and a drink. I was able to select a
                    drink from their fridge, which was right next to the cash register. They had regular pop and some
                    international drinks. I decided to try out this Turkish currant soft drink, it was pretty good! In
                    terms of the falafel sandwich, it was also delicious. The fries were decent; they came out plain,
                    but you can salt them yourself obviously. I tried my friend's chicken shawarma, and wow, it was
                    amazing. The spices made it incredibly flavorful, and it was so juicy, you wouldn't believe it.
                </p>
                <p class="max-w-100 md:max-w-150 text-lg">
                    If you get anything from this place,
                    get the chicken shawarma. Whatever sauce they had in both wraps were good as well. It's a casual
                    place run by a few chill guys. I want to come back, I noticed on their menu that they had
                    traditional family style "feasts", which seemed super flavorful just looking at the pictures. I'm
                    not sure who the owners are, but from the pictures and iconography, they are of Iraqi or Palestinian
                    origin. I recommend this place, I would rate it a <b>6.5 out of 7!</b>
